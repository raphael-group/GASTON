# GASTON

GASTON is an interpretable deep learning model for learning a _topographic map_ of a tissue slice from spatially resolved transcriptomics (SRT) data. Specifically, GASTON models gene expression topography by learning the _isodepth_, a 1-D coordinate that smoothly varies across a tissue slice.

</p>

The isodepth and topographic map learned by GASTON have many downstream applications including
* identifying **spatial domains**,
* inferring **continuous gradients** and **discontinuous jumps** in gene expression,
* deriving maps of spatial variation in **cell type organization**,
* analyzing continuous gradients in the **tumor microenvironment**

## Installation
First install conda environment from `environment.yml` file:

```
cd GASTON
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Then install GASTON using pip.

```
conda activate gaston-package
pip install -e .
```

Installation should take <10 minutes. We will add GASTON to PyPI and Bioconda soon! 

## Getting started

Check out our [readthedocs](https://gaston.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), which includes tutorials for four analyses: 
* mouse cerebellum (Slide-SeqV2)
* human colorectal tumor (10x Visium)
* human breast cancer tumor (10x Xenium)
* mouse cortex (MERFISH).

Training GASTON by following the tutorials should take <1 hour.

GASTON requires an NxG gene expression matrix (e.g. UMI counts) and an Nx2 spatial location matrix, which can be provided or read from Space Ranger output.

The data to run the tutorials is located in `docs/notebooks/tutorials/`. Note that due to Github size constraints, you have to download the counts matrices for both analyses from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GiibZwhpzlur8C1hNHa1g7I4jsc1Gmn7?usp=sharing). 

## Software dependencies
* torch (=2.0.0)
* matplotlib (=3.8.0)
* pandas (=2.1.1)
* scikit-learn (=1.3.1)

* seaborn (=0.12.2)
* tqdm (=4.66.1)
* scipy (=1.11.2)
